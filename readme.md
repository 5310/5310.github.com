5310's Gh-page Profile
======================

This is a bare-bones gh-page site for the [5310.github.com](5310.github.com) domain that Github generously reserves for 'Hubbers.

The page isn't really say much; it just points to my [Github](https://github.com/5310/) and [Google](http://gplus.to/scio) profiles at the moment.

It uses the [Initalizr](http://www.initializr.com/) HTML5 boilerplate and uses [Eric Meyer's CSS Reset 2.0](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/), FYI.
